# AppleBee's Database Based Menu

This is a silly little practice project based off the AppleBee's menu. It's purpose is to practice basic Laravel stuff with.

## Reason for Existence

The only reason this project exists is because my supervisor commanded it. So therefore it came into existence.

##Installation

I don't know why you'd want this, but assuming you have a Laravel Homestead set up on your machine, you should be able to just clone or fork the repo, create your own database(as that wasn't uploaded), to do this you should make a **database.sqlite** in your database directory, then just run **php artisan migrate** in the project folder in your terminal. That will recreate the database.
